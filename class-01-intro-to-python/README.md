Ensure that you've completed the [401 Python Pre-work](https://github.com/codefellows/code-401-Python-prework) .

It's extremely critical that you're set up and ready to go on day 1, and if not you need to **notify your instructor** as soon as possible regarding any of the pre-work that you were unable to complete (including what you were able to complete).
