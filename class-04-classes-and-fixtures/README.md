## Daily Plan
- Notes:
    - Anything top of mind?
    - Catch-up time this weekend (maybe Friday as well)

- Code Review
- Python Classes / Object Oriented Programming
- PyTest Fixtures
- Lambdas & Functional Methods (if time permits) 
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

- Students will learn about how to properly use the Python lambda function
- Students will learn about the sorted, map, and filter functions
- Students will finally encounter the Python class, and begin working with basic OOP Principles
- Students will write better test suites by abstracting reusable objects into fixtures

## Outline

- Code Review
- [Object-Oriented Programming and Python Classes]
- [Class Inheritance and Composition]
- [Anonymous Functions and Functional Programming]
- [Pytest Fixtures]
